# Transcription: picking a Parakeet runtime

Research notes for the step after v0.1. Nothing here is implemented yet.

## Can Parakeet be prompted?

**No.** Parakeet has no text input, and this is architectural rather than a
missing feature.

Whisper's decoder is an autoregressive transformer over text, so you can prefix
it with `initial_prompt` and the model conditions on those tokens. Parakeet TDT
is a Token-and-Duration Transducer: a Conformer encoder feeding a small
prediction network that only ever sees the tokens it has already emitted. There
is no slot for an instruction. Of NVIDIA's ASR family only
[Canary](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3/discussions/8)
takes text prompts.

So "transcribe this as bullet points" or "the speaker is French" cannot be
passed to the model. Two things cover what you'd actually want from a prompt:

### 1. Custom vocabulary — for names and jargon

This is the real answer to "get proper nouns right", and it's better than the
string substitution originally sketched out.

FluidAudio ships
[context biasing](https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio/blob/main/Documentation/ASR/CustomVocabulary.md):
a CTC keyword spotter scores your terms against the frame-level acoustic
evidence, then a rescorer decides whether the acoustic support for your term
beats what the decoder emitted. If you say "NVIDIA" and the model writes "in
video", the spotter finds *NVIDIA* in the audio itself and swaps it.

That's the important distinction from post-hoc substitution: a find-and-replace
on "in video" → "NVIDIA" corrupts a genuine sentence about video. Biasing looks
at the acoustics and only fires when the audio actually supports the term.

```swift
let vocabulary = CustomVocabularyContext(terms: [
    CustomVocabularyTerm(text: "NVIDIA"),
    CustomVocabularyTerm(text: "Häagen-Dazs", aliases: ["Hagen Das"]),
])
let result = try await asrManager.transcribe(samples, customVocabulary: vocabulary)
```

Documented at 99.4% recall, no latency impact up to ~100 terms, tested to 230+.
Single words beat multi-word phrases. Maps cleanly onto a YAML list:

```yaml
vocabulary:
  - Parakeet
  - ParrotFlow
  - Zylbersztejn
  - text: Häagen-Dazs
    aliases: [Hagen Das]
```

Caveat: biasing needs the complete log-probability matrix, so it is
weaker in streaming mode. Not a problem for us — we transcribe a finished clip.

### 2. A local LLM pass — for everything else

Free-form instructions ("strip filler words", "format as bullets", "keep it
terse") belong in a second stage that reads the finished transcript. On macOS
26+ Apple's Foundation Models framework gives a local LLM with no download and
no dependency; an MLX model is the fallback for older systems.

Worth keeping optional and off by default. It adds latency to every dictation
and can rewrite things you meant literally.

## Runtime options

| Option | Language | Ships as | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [FluidAudio](https://github.com/FluidInference/FluidAudio) | Swift | SPM package, CoreML on ANE | **Recommended** |
| [parakeet-coreml-swift](https://github.com/mweinbach/parakeet-coreml-swift) | Swift | SPM package, CoreML | Leaner, fewer features |
| [parakeet-mlx](https://github.com/senstella/parakeet-mlx) | Python | pip + MLX | Needs a Python runtime |
| [Apple SpeechAnalyzer](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/277/) | Swift | OS framework | No model to ship at all |

**parakeet-mlx is out.** It would mean bundling a Python interpreter and its
wheels into a Mac app, or making users manage a venv. That contradicts the
whole "small, lightweight, one download" goal.

**FluidAudio is the pick.** Apache 2.0, one SPM line, runs on the Neural Engine,
~190× real-time on an M4 Pro, and it already solves the vocabulary problem —
which is otherwise the hardest part of this project to do well.

Its input format is "16 kHz mono Float32", which is exactly what `Recorder.swift`
already writes. That was the point of fixing the audio format in v0.1.

```swift
let models = try await AsrModels.downloadAndLoad(version: .v3)
let asrManager = AsrManager(config: .default)
try await asrManager.configure(models: models)
let result = try await asrManager.transcribe(samples, source: .system)
```

### Apple SpeechAnalyzer deserves a look

macOS 26 added `SpeechAnalyzer` / `SpeechTranscriber` — on-device, streaming,
with models the OS downloads and manages. Reportedly ~2× faster than Whisper
Large V3 Turbo.

It is genuinely tempting: **zero model bytes to ship**, no first-run download,
no ~1 GB in the app's cache, and Apple maintains it. The costs are macOS 26+
only, less control over the model, and no equivalent of FluidAudio's acoustic
context biasing (the older `contextualStrings` is a weaker mechanism).

Worth a spike before committing to Parakeet. If quality is comparable on your
voice, it removes the single largest chunk of complexity in shipping this app.
It's also a sensible fallback on machines where the Parakeet download fails.

## Model size — the thing that shapes the install

The HuggingFace repo for v3 CoreML totals **~3.0 GB**, but that's every variant
in both `.mlpackage` and compiled `.mlmodelc` form. A working set is roughly:

| File | Size |
| --- | --- |
| MelEncoder | 595 MB |
| Encoder (fp) | 445 MB |
| Encoder (int4 alternative) | 298 MB |
| ParakeetDecoder | 37 MB |
| JointDecision | 13 MB |

So **~700 MB–1.1 GB** downloaded on first run, depending on the encoder variant.

This must not go in the app bundle — it would make a ~1 GB download for
something that is otherwise a few hundred KB, and it breaks the Homebrew route.
Download on first launch into `~/Library/Caches`, with visible progress,
a resumable transfer, and a working app (record-only) until it lands.

## Proposed order

1. Spike Apple `SpeechTranscriber` — cheapest possible path, decide on quality.
2. Wire FluidAudio behind a `transcription.engine` config key, so both can coexist.
3. Insert text into the frontmost app (needs Accessibility — see
   [distribution.md](distribution.md)).
4. Custom vocabulary from YAML.
5. Optional LLM cleanup pass, off by default.
