/// What happens to a transcript between the model finishing and the text
/// landing in your editor.
///
/// It was always a pipeline — exact replacements, then fuzzy ones, then spoken
/// numbers — but the order lived in one function and each step was switched by
/// a boolean of its own. That works until you want a fourth step, or the same
/// three in a different order for a different language, and neither is
/// expressible in a flag.
///
/// So the order becomes data: a list of stages per language, read from the
/// config. This type is the list and the running of it, and nothing else. Every
/// stage is `String -> String` and already had its own validation set before it
/// was a stage; what is new here is only that they are named, ordered and
/// selected from outside the code.
///
/// The language a transcript is in is resolved here, because it is what picks
/// the pipeline. It is *not* handed down to the stages: `numbers` keeps its own
/// resolution, and has to. Its rule is not "read this language" but "try the
/// detected one, then the others, and let a candidate win only on real
/// evidence" — the guard that stops French reading the "cents" in "I have 99
/// cents" as hundreds. Collapsing that to one language here would quietly
/// delete it.
